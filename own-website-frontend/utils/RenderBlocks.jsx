//you have a component (renderblock) which gets a layout as a property. it maps through the layout and the layout is an array of blocks. for every block,it looks up in the blocklist file and finds blocktype (think of it as the slug) and then it retrieves the block that is defined witih the slug. lastly, it will render the block with all the data you had provided it with

import { blocks } from "@/blocks/blockList";
import React from 'react';

const RenderBlocks = ({ layout }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            {layout?.length > 0 &&
                layout.map((block, i) => {
                    const Block = blocks[block.blockType];

                    if (Block) {
                        return <Block key={i} {...block} />;
                    }

                    return null;
                })}
        </div>
    )
};

export default RenderBlocks;
